# Navigation

Navigation is the cornerstone of most (if not all) websites and web applications. There are many ways to implement navigation, some more accessible and usable than others.

- [Simple - a set of links; no fancy menu behavior](simple.html)
- [Collapsible - dropdowns with simple expand on click or hover](collapsible.html)
 

## Representing Navigation as a Tree

IMO, this is the correct way to implement deeply nested navigation.
