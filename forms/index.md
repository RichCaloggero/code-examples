## ARIA radio button and checkbox examples

This example shows how to create radio buttons and checkboxes which respond to the keyboard, and send their results via hidden form elements.

## Limitations

- arrow buttons do not work to choose among radio buttons; use tab
- currently visual state is shown via text; most people will want to use images
